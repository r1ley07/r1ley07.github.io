# How I passed the OSCP on my first attempt....

## A short intro

First of all, let me start by saying I'm not an expert by any stretch of the imagination, so these are just my opinions. I recently passed the OSCP and believe me, *if I can, then so can you*. I was constantly going back and forth with myself about whether I was ready to attempt it, if I needed more background knowledge etc. Let's get things straight, I don't think it's a sensible idea to jump straight into the OSCP with no prior knowledge of certain fundamentals, however we'll get into that later! 

What I will say is, if you do want to make an attempt at gaining this certification, then give yourself a realistic time-period, devise a plan and get cracking! It is possible!

## A quick insight into my background

So, to keep it short and sweet (because I can make it long, believe me) I'll give you a bit of information about my background. I'm not the typical IT professional who was started programming from young, enjoyed playing around with hardware etc. Don't get me wrong, I was always on my laptop, but most of the time it was for gaming purposes.

When I started university I chose the completely wrong course, Economics. Yes, I know, what was I thinking, but to be quite honest I had no clue what to study and so decided to choose quite a broad subject. 2 years later, having failed my second year, I changed course and university to study Computing. Another 3 years later I had my bachelors degree, before embarking on another year of study. At the end of that year I had my masters' degree in Information Security. Within my time at university I had some modules on security that interested me quite a lot. I decided to do some extra-curricular study and gained Security+ and SSCP. Upon doing further research and speaking to people I found out about the world of offensive security. *Enter the OSCP*.


## The Course Prerequisites

The Offensive Security website mentiones the following three things as fundamentals that all students should have:

1. Solid understanding of TCP/IP networking
2. Reasonable understanding of Linux
3. Familiarity of Bash scripting with basic Python or Perl a plus

Now I understand that there are some courses, which I won't mention, which mention supposed pre-requisites that are not actually needed. However with PWK/OSCP being a practical course, all of these three are definitely necessary. 

Networking - The basics should be enough to get you through this course. I'm not a networking wiz myself, so as long as you understand different protocols, the OSI model, subnetting, IP addresses and things of a similar nature you should be fine. 

Linux - I think this goes without saying. This is going to be the OS that you're using on the course. So if you're completely new to it, I suggest finding a Linux course which covers basic commands, the file directory system etc. Also, make sure you know basic Windows commands used in a command prompt (cmd). Trust me, I had to learn the hard way ie. knowing the 'cat' command on Linux but not knowing the 'type' command on Windows.

Scripting - One of my biggest obstacles in starting the course. For some reason, I created this belief that the OSCP was going to be full of coding in multiple different languages and that I wouldn't be able to manage it. Upon starting the course I realised that you don't have to be an elite coder, however knowing data types, what variables are, how to declare them and things of this nature will help a lot along this journey.

The last thing I think anyone looking to start PWK needs is a determined mindset. Trust me, and I mean trust me, there will be times on this course where you literally don't know what to do. You may find something you believe should be working isn't. And let's not mention the famous 'rabbit holes'. They got me big time. What I'm basically trying to say is, if you're not willing to be researching heavily, staying up those extra hours to gain that foothold or willing to go through that file system again to find potential creds then this course is not for you. However, if you are and want that status as an OSCP, then let's move on!

## Course Prep

So before getting into how I prepared for this course, I should first let you know that when I want to start anything, I research **heavily**. So the first thing I did was read as many blogs as I could about how other's prepared. I then took a [Linux course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-linux-in-5-days/) on Udemy, ran through a textbook on the [Basics of Hacking & Penetration Testing](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Basics-Hacking-Penetration-Testing-Syngress/dp/1597496553) and thought I would be ready. I was wrong. I was working that summer, in an InfoSec department, and one of my colleagues suggested the [eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester](https://www.elearnsecurity.com/certification/ejpt/) course to me, as a way to slowly ease myself into a tough course like the OSCP. It turns out it was just what I needed. Once I got through that, I started on HackTheBox, which I can't recommend enough. The problem I feel a lot of people encouter with the OSCP is that they enter with minimal knowledge of the command line, tools and techniques used. I can't speak for everyone, but for me when I first started on the command line I was completely overwhelmed thinking how am I ever going to be able to navigate this! I think HackTheBox is great with allowing you to experience CTF's and being on the command line, which makes starting the OSCP much less daunting. I then bought the eCPPT, which is kind of known as an OSCP-lite course. It's a great course covering a lot of more up-to-date type of attacks. Once getting through the material I never actually took the exam, due to being busy at the time. When I finally got back to it, I decided to not do that exam (which I will do at some point), but purchase the PWK/OSCP and start that course instead.

## PWK Course Experience

You get given the PWK course PDF and videos. I went through these first before I went through the labs and I would recommend you do the same. It just makes life a bit easier. Personally, I found the material to be quite good, however I do think they could have been better. In some instances, I would have been quite confused and wouldn't have known what to do if I didn't have prior knowledge, but I think this ties into OffSec's motto of try harder and the idea that they want their students to go out and do the independent research. Once I got through the PDF and videos I then started in the labs!

The labs were a lot of fun for me. It taught me a lot in terms of different ways to enumerate a target as well as exploiting them. I would recommend that you try actually understand the methodology behind how you initially gained a foothold to gaining a root/admin shell rather than rushing through all of the labs. Something that helped me a lot in the labs was Ippsec's videos on YouTube. He goes through retired machines on HackTheBox detailing his methodology, tools and techniques used. If you watch these, note down his techniques and try to implement them in the labs you'll definetely find that your in a lot of luck. **Please** don't be in a competition with yourself/others to get through all the machines in the labs! Your goal should be to understand your methodology clearly and make sure that you're getting from the enumeration phase to the exploitation phase as effeciently as possible. Whether that's in 10 machines or 50, it doesn't matter. There are forums there to help and although people say you shouldn't use them regularly, I did and found that I learned a lot in there.

I logged my hours and spent about 320 in the 90 day period that I bought, rooting around 47 machines. Don't see that and think you have to do as many hours as I did, as you may do less and be perfectly ready for the exam. Just go at your own pace! 

Once my lab time expired and I had booked the exam, I went through retired machines on HackTheBox. These helped immensely, especially when going through other's writeups and seeing different ways the same result was achieved.

Lastly, what I will say is try to find a balance being studying and life. I'm an avid gym-goer which I found helped a lot with easing pressure on myself. Go out with friends, socialise etc. A healthy balance goes a long way to remaining cool, calm and collected.


## THE EXAM

The title is written in caps for dramatic effect, but to be honest I didn't find my exam expierience to be too daunting. I thought I would be way more nervous than I was, but I think I psyched myself up so much that it would be ridiculously hard that it actualy wasn't that bad.

You get given a 24 hour period, well 23hrs45mins, with 5 hosts to root. You first connect with the proctor, set up the software and then you're good to go. I started, and well to cut a long story short, within 9-10 hours gone I had rooted 4/5 boxes, having enough points to pass. I sat there quite confused, thinking that it was supposed to be way harder. But I guess it shows, if you do put in the work, then it will pay off. Again I'm not a computer wiz, **so you can do this too and better!** I slept for a few hours, being getting back to it. I didn't manage to root the last box, so I logged off with 10 mins to go, before going to sleep.

I woke up the following morning, relaxed most of the day and got my report done in the evening. **Do your report properly**, people with 5/5 boxes rooted have failed for poor reporting! I sent it off and continued with life. 2 weeks later I got an email stating that I had passed!

To end, even if you don't pass the first time, it really doesn't matter. You'll just be more prepared for the next attempt. The OSCP is meant to be hard, that's why everyone doesn't have it and it will just be that much sweeter when you finally get it!
